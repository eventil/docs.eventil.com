## Cooperations

You can choose with which groups you want to cooperate on your event. You don't have to manage everything on your own. By default event creator is the one that can manage the event. You can easily modify this by cooperation with group. After you pick groups you would like to cooperate and submit request, one of group aministrators will have to accept it. When it is done all group(s) administrators will be given access to your event management. The restult of accepted cooperation is visible on the event page - all event administrators will be listed there with all cooperating groups below.
