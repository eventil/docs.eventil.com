## Presentations

Here's a list of presentations submitted to your event in response to Call for Proposals.

At the beginning presentations are marked as "pending" and they wait for your action. You can then mark them as accepted, rejected or votable. You can also publish them (only after publishing they will be visible on your event page). Once marked, you can browse them in specific groups.
